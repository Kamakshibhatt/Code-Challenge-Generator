# Code Challenge Generator

A full-stack web application that generates coding challenges dynamically using **FastAPI (Python)** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.  
The project integrates **Clerk** for authentication, uses a **database** for persistence, and leverages **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to create custom coding problems.
